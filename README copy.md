## Application MVP
To make a venue app for 3 venues complete with a set of scheduling features through an integrated calender react component. A log in page for the admin of the site to check information and times for customers.
- The user can see information about three venues
- The user can see book a photographer and see the photographers gallery.
- The user can see when the selected venue is available to rent and book from the website.
- The user can get more information about the city in which the venues are located in.
- The user can contact the owner if they have questions about the venue.
- The owner will be able to log in and see what times have been selected and further communicate with the customer.

## Project Description
The features will include a venue rentals page for showing information on the venues and be linked to a calendar that will be linked to a database to pull information on available dates for each venue. It will feature a photoshoot page that will integrate with an API to ensure dynamic photos are shown from the photographer. The calendar is the central hub of our project. There the user will see what days the three venues are available after choosing a venue that they would like. We will have a page dedicated to defining the city that the three venues are located in. We will also have a contact us page so they may get in touch with the owner easy.

## Concept
This platform is a full stack web application that will allow a customer with an event in mind to see what pictures of a venue and schedule a time and date the venue is available. One of the most stressful parts of planning an event is the "Where are we going to have it and is it available on this day?". Bartlett venues will deliver an easy to use interface with integrated calendar to find days and book the venue in a snap.
