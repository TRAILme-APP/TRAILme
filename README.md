- The user can find hiking trails based on a particular difficulty level.
- The user can login to a personal portal to view previous liked trails and see graph data for various aspects of their trail run.
- The user can see pictures of the trails near them or a specific zip code.
- The user can see a 10 day forecast for the area selected.
